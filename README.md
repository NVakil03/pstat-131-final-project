# Predicting Used Car Prices
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car using features such as its make, model, year, mileage, exterior and interior colors, reported accidents, and number of previous owners. We explore various machine learning methods to develop the most accurate regression model for this task.
